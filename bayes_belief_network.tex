\noindent When two features are correlated, the independent assumption in Naive Bayes Classifier is not true, i.e. when $P(X_1 , X_2 | Y) = P(X_1 | Y)$
$$P(X_1 , X_2 | Y) \ne P(X_1 | Y) \times P(X_2 | Y)$$

\noindent Bayesian network provides a graphical representation of the probabilistic relationships among a set of random variables. There are two key elements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A directed acyclic graph that shows the dependence relationships among set of variables
    \item A probability table associating each node to its immediate parent nodes
\end{enumerate}

\noindent To determine whether two nodes are conditionally independent, we can use Bayes Ball Theorem, which will be discussed in section \ref{section:dseparation}. \\

\noindent The conditional probability table (CPT) of a node is constructed by only considering its direct parents. If a node $X$ has no parent, then CPT only contains $P(X)$. If a node $X$ has $Z_1, Z_2$ direct parents, then CPT contains $P(X|Z_1Z_2)$.
